No human should consider delegation of responsibility as the right to absolute authority

We need organise hierarchically purely for the purposes of efficient organisation.

These are artificial constructs and hold no bearing. No one is truly above anyone. It is only necessary for the functioning of orginizations

Treat all humans equally
